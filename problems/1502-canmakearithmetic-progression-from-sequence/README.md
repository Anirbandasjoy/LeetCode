## Problem

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

> **Input:**  
> `arr = [3, 5, 1]`  
> **Output:**  
> `true`
>
> **Explanation:**  
> We can reorder the elements as `[1, 3, 5]`, with differences of 2 between consecutive elements.

---

### Example 2

> **Input:**  
> `arr = [1, 2, 4]`  
> **Output:**  
> `false`
>
> **Explanation:**  
> There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.

## Constraints

- `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
