# LeetCode Problem Solving with TypeScript

This repository contains my personal solutions to various algorithm and data structure problems from LeetCode, implemented in TypeScript. The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills and write clean, readable, and efficient code.

## About This Repository

- All problems are solved manually without using built-in helper methods (unless allowed).
- Focused on understanding the underlying logic behind each problem.
- Most solutions are written with beginner-friendly logic using loops, arrays, and conditionals.
- Some problems are solved with restrictions (e.g., no use of `sort()`, `includes()`, etc.) to simulate interview environments.

## Technologies Used

- Language: TypeScript
- Platform: LeetCode
- Editor: VS Code

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

2. Open the project in your preferred editor.

3. Run individual TypeScript files to test the logic:

4. Start Command `yarn dev problems/folder-name/filename.ts`

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers strong typing and better tooling, which helps in writing more predictable and error-free code during problem-solving.
